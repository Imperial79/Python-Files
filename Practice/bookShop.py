'''Consider an example of book shop which sells books & video tapes. Itâ€™s modelled by Book & Tape classes. These two classes are inherited from the abstract class called Media. The Media class has common data members such as title & publication. The Book class has data member for storing a no. of pages in a book & Tape class has the playing time in a tape. Each class will have method such as read () & show (). Write a program that models this class hierarchy & processes objects using reference to base class only.'''
