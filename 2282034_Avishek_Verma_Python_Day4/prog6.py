'''
6. sin(x) can be calculated approximately by summing the terms of the infinite series as follows
sin(x) = x - x**3/3! + x**5/5! - x**7/7! â€¦
where x is expressed in radians. Write function(s) to calculate the value of sin x, accepting x as degree from user. Compare your results with that of math.sin().
